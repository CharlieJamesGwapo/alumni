IMPORT ERROR FIX - FINAL VERSION
================================

WHAT WAS FIXED:
1. Added dataType: 'json' to force JSON parsing
2. Added better error logging to browser console
3. Added JSON extraction from response (in case of extra output)
4. Added fatal error catching in ajax.php
5. Added cache control headers

HOW TO TEST:
1. Drop the database in phpMyAdmin
2. Go to http://localhost/alumni/admin/index.php?page=backup
3. Upload your backup SQL file
4. Click "Import Database"
5. Open browser console (F12) to see detailed logs

WHAT TO CHECK IN BROWSER CONSOLE:
- Look for "Raw response:" log
- Look for "Response type:" log  
- Look for "Parsed response:" log
- If there's an error, it will show the actual response

IF YOU STILL SEE "Invalid response from server":
1. Press F12 to open browser console
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for the logged response
4. Take a screenshot and share it
5. Also check the Network tab to see the actual response from ajax.php

The system will now show you exactly what's wrong in the console!
